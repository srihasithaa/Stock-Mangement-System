# Stock Management System DBMS Project

This repository contains the SQL code for a Stock Management System implemented in a relational database management system (RDBMS). The project includes the creation of tables, insertion of sample data, and the implementation of various SQL queries and views for managing stocks, portfolios, transactions, investors, and market data.

# Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

1. **Stock:** Stores information about stocks, including stock ID, symbol, company name, current price, sector, and quantity available.
2. **Portfolio:** Manages portfolios of investors, recording details such as portfolio ID, investor ID, stock ID, purchase price, purchase date, and quantity owned.
3. **Transaction:** Records transactions made by investors, capturing transaction ID, investor ID, stock ID, transaction type (buy/sell), quantity, and transaction price.
4. **Investor:** Stores investor details such as investor ID, first name, last name, email, phone, and account balance.
5. **MarketData:** Contains market data for stocks, including market data ID, stock ID, date, open price, close price, high price, and low price.

# Queries and Views

The repository includes SQL queries and views for performing various operations on the database:

1. **Queries:** Retrieve information such as investor account balances, total transaction values, transactions made by specific investors, and highest closing prices for stocks.
2. **Views:** Define views to display portfolio details, transaction details, total portfolio values, investor contact information, and market data for stocks.

# Getting Started

1. Create a database named **SMS**.
2. Execute the SQL scripts provided in the repository to create tables, insert sample data, and define queries and views.
